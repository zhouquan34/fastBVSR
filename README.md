"examples" gives some example commands for running fastBVSR in terminal. 

If you have C++ GSL library installed, you can try compiling the code yourself. An example Makefile is provided. 

Some may find it convenient to run the program in R. An example is given in the folder R-mac. It is only for Mac OS. 

Thanks for your interest. My personal email: zhouquan.stat@gmail.com
